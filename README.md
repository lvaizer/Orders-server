# Orders-server
### Liron Vaizer`s Node.js practice

I have built this project to practice creating a API server written in Node.js using Express.

This API server is implemented by frontend that I have build stored on my other repository called "Orders-system" (https://github.com/lvaizer/orders_system)

This project was uploaded to [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/).
